/*
This folder contains resources for procedural quest generation using
the Dialogue System integration.

The "Demo Generator Conversations" database is an additional dialogue
database that the demo scene loads using an Extra Databases component.
The demo's main database and this database have been run through the
Dialogue System's Unique ID Tool to ensure that their internal ID
numbers don't conflict when both databases are loaded.
