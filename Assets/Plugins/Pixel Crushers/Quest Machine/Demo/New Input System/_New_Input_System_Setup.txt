To make the demo work with Unity's optional Input System package:

1. Use the Package Manager window to install the Input System package.

2. Select menu item Tools > Pixel Crushers > Dialogue System > Welcome Window.
   Tick the USE_NEW_INPUT checkbox.
   
3. Open the Demo scene. 
   - Inspect EventSystem. Click the button to update it for the Input System.

The demo's Quest Machine prefab has a script that registers inputs with
the Input Device Manager component as described in the PDF
Plugins / Pixel Crushers / Common / Documentation / Input_Device_Manager_Manual.pdf.
